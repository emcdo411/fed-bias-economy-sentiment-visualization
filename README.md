# Federal Reserve Bias & Economic Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores public perceptions and sentiment regarding the **Federal Reserve** (Fed) and the **U.S. economy**. It uses state-level data to analyze:

1. **Political Bias of the Federal Reserve**  
   - Investigating the perceived political leanings of the Fed across U.S. states.
2. **Economic Sentiment**  
   - Analyzing public sentiment on the U.S. economy across states.

The data is visualized in interactive maps using **RStudio**, providing insights into how different states perceive the Federal Reserve and their view on the U.S. economy.

### Project Goals
- To visualize the **perceived political bias** of the Federal Reserve by state.
- To assess the **economic sentiment** regarding the U.S. economy on a state-by-state basis.
- To utilize **open data** to explore public opinion and enhance data-driven decision-making.

## Files Included

The following CSV files are included in this project:

- **[fed_bias_poll_by_state.csv](sandbox:/mnt/data/fed_bias_poll_by_state.csv)**: State-level data on perceived political bias of the Federal Reserve.
- **[economic_sentiment_poll_by_state.csv](sandbox:/mnt/data/economic_sentiment_poll_by_state.csv)**: State-level data on public sentiment regarding the U.S. economy.
  
### Example of CSV Data:

#### **fed_bias_poll_by_state.csv**
| State        | Political Affiliation | Percentage Believing Fed Favors Opposite Party |
|--------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Alabama      | Republican            | 55%                                           |
| Alaska       | Independent           | 48%                                           |
| Arizona      | Democrat              | 60%                                           |

## R Code for Data Visualizations

The following R code is used to visualize the data:

### 1. **Federal Reserve Bias by State**:
```r
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(maps)
library(sf)

# Load the Federal Reserve Bias Poll data (state-level)
bias_data <- read_csv("fed_bias_poll_by_state.csv")

# Load US states map data
states_map <- map_data("state")

# Merge poll data with map data
bias_data$State <- tolower(bias_data$State)  # Ensure state names match the map data
map_data_bias <- left_join(states_map, bias_data, by = c("region" = "State"))

# Plot Federal Reserve Bias by State
ggplot(map_data_bias, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group, fill=`Percentage Believing Fed Favors Opposite Party`)) +
  geom_polygon(color="white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low="lightblue", high="darkblue") +
  labs(title="Perceived Political Bias of the Federal Reserve by State",
       fill="Bias Perception (%)") +
  theme_void()
```

### 2. **Economic Sentiment by State**:
```r
# Load the Economic Sentiment Poll data (state-level)
economic_data <- read_csv("economic_sentiment_poll_by_state.csv")

# Ensure state names are in lowercase
economic_data$State <- tolower(economic_data$State)

# Merge with US states map data
map_data_economy <- left_join(states_map, economic_data, by = c("region" = "State"))

# Plot Economic Sentiment by State
ggplot(map_data_economy, aes(x=long, y=lat, group=group, fill=`Percentage of Registered Voters`)) +
  geom_polygon(color="white") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low="gray", high="green") +
  labs(title="Public Sentiment on U.S. Economy by State",
       fill="Economy Sentiment (%)") +
  theme_void()
```
